Authors can request their artifact to be evaluated towards one, two, or all of the following badges:

* **Available.** To earn this badge, the AEC must judge that the artifact associated with the paper has been made available for retrieval *permanently and publicly*. However, an artifact undergoing AE often evolves as a consequence of the AEC feedback it receives. Therefore, if authors opt for "volatile" storage for the initial submission, they must commit to uploading their materials to public services for permanent storage if the badge is awarded. We encourage authors to consider services such as Zenodo, FigShare, or Dryad that also create a citable DOI, which the final artifact appendix version for publication must mention. Other options, such as GitHub and GitLab, are also acceptable if a stable reference to the evaluated version (e.g., a commit hash or tag) is provided in the final appendix version. Furthermore, for this badge, a README file explicitly referencing the paper and a LICENSE file should be provided.

* **Functional.** To earn this badge, the AEC must judge that the artifact conforms to the expectations set by the paper for functionality, usability, and relevance. Also, an artifact must be usable on *other machines* than the authorsâ€™, including when specialized hardware is required (for example, paths, addresses, and identifiers must not be hardcoded.) The AEC will particularly consider three aspects:
	* *Documentation*: is the artifact sufficiently documented to be exercised by readers of the paper?
	* *Completeness*: does the submitted artifact include all of the key components described in the paper?
	* *Exercisability*: does the submitted artifact include the scripts and data needed to run the experiments described in the paper, and can the software be successfully executed?

* **Reproduced.** To earn this badge, the AEC must judge that they can use the submitted artifact to obtain the main results presented in the paper. In short, is it possible for the AEC to independently repeat the experiments and obtain results that support the main claims made by the paper? The goal of this effort is not to reproduce the results exactly, but instead to generate results independently within an allowed tolerance such that the main claims of the paper are validated. For example, in the case of lengthy experiments, scaled-down versions can be proposed if clearly and convincingly explained for their significance.
